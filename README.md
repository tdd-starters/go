# GO TDD Starter
Simple starter for getting started with TDD in Go.

The file _calculator/calculator_test.go_ contains one test case and a few in comments. Start by coming
up with a few test cases and add them to the lists, then implement them one at a time, test-driving the
solution forwards.

## Libraries
- github.com/stretchr/testify for the _assert_ package

## Running
There is a Makefile with some standard targets, run

```shell
$ make test
```

to run all the tests
